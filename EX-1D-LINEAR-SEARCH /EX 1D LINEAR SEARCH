# EX 1D LINEAR SEARCH
# DATE:
# AIM:
To write a Python program to implement Linear Search on a given tuple by converting a list to a tuple (since tuples are immutable).

# ALGORITHM:
STEP1:Start the program

STEP2:Input a list from the user or define it in the program.

STEP3:Convert the list to a tuple.

STEP4:Input the element to be searched.

STEP5:Traverse each element in the tuple one by one.

STEP6:If not found after the loop, display "Element not found".

STEP 7:End the program

# PROGRAM:
```

```
```
def linear_search(n,tup, x):
    for i in range(len(tup)):
        if x == tup[i]:
            print("Tuple:",x,"found")
            break
    else:
        print("Tuple:",x,"not found")

n = int(input())
arr = [] 
for i in range(n):
    l = int(input())
    arr.append(l)
tup = tuple(arr)
x = int(input())
linear_search(n,tup, x)
```

# RESUTL:
Thus, the program was successfully executed and linear search was performed on the tuple.
